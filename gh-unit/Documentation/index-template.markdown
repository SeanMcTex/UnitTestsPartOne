To build the framework for iOS, run `make` from within the `Project-iOS` directory. The framework is in `Project-iOS/build/Framework/`.

GHUnit was inspired by and uses parts of GTM (google-toolbox-for-mac) code, mostly from [UnitTesting](http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/source/browse/trunk/UnitTesting/)
